## Overview

TexCoordChaser2D generates a series of single floating-point values that progressively change from initial value to destination value.

The TexCoordChaser2D node belongs to the **Followers** component and its default container field is *children.* It is available since X3D version 3.3 or later.

## Fields

### SFNode [in, out] **metadata** NULL <small>[X3DMetadataObject]</small>

Metadata are not part of the X3D world and not interpreted by the X3D browser, but they can be accessed via the ECMAScript interface.

### MFVec2f [in] **set_value**

Set_value resets current value of this node.

### MFVec2f [in] **set_destination**

Set_destination resets destination value of this node.

### MFVec2f [ ] **initialValue** [ ]

Initial starting value for this node.

### MFVec2f [ ] **initialDestination** [ ]

Initial destination value for this node.

### SFTime [ ] **duration** 1 <small>[0,âˆž)</small>

Duration is the time interval for filter response in seconds.

### SFBool [out] **isActive**

IsActive true/false events are sent when follower-node computation starts/stops.

### MFVec2f [out] **value_changed**

Computed output value that approaches within tolerance of destination value, as determined by elapsed time, order and tau.

## Description

### Hint

- value_changed output events can be ROUTEd to a `<TextureTransform>` node's translation field, for example.
