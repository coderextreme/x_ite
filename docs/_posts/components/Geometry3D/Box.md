## Overview

Box is a geometry node.

The Box node belongs to the **Geometry3D** component and its default container field is *geometry.* It is available since X3D version 3.0 or later.

## Fields

### SFNode [in, out] **metadata** NULL <small>[X3DMetadataObject]</small>

Metadata are not part of the X3D world and not interpreted by the X3D browser, but they can be accessed via the ECMAScript interface.

### SFVec3f [ ] **size** 2 2 2 <small>(0,âˆž)</small>

Size x y z in meters.

#### Warning

Simple-geometry dimensions are initializeOnly and cannot be changed after initial creation, for animation use Transform scale instead.

### SFBool [ ] **solid** TRUE

Setting solid true means draw only one side of polygons (backface culling on), setting solid false means draw both sides of polygons (backface culling off).

#### Hint

If in doubt, use solid='false' for maximum visibility.

#### Warnings

Default value true can completely hide geometry if viewed from wrong side! Solid false not supported in VRML97.

## Description

### Hint

- Insert a Shape node before adding geometry or Appearance.
