## Overview

Rectangle2D is a geometry node that defines a 2D rectangle in X-Y plane.

The Rectangle2D node belongs to the **Geometry2D** component and its default container field is *geometry.* It is available from X3D version 3.0 or higher.

## Fields

### SFNode [in, out] **metadata** NULL <small>[X3DMetadataObject]</small>

Information about this node can be contained in a MetadataBoolean, MetadataDouble, MetadataFloat, MetadataInteger, MetadataString or MetadataSet node.

#### Hint

- [X3D Architecture 7.2.4 Metadata](https://www.web3d.org/specifications/X3Dv4Draft/ISO-IEC19775-1v4-CD1/Part01/components/core.html#Metadata){:target="_blank"}

### SFVec2f [ ] **size** 2 2 <small>(0,âˆž)</small>

2D dimensions of Rectangle2D.

#### Hint

- For *size* animation, modify the scale of a parent/ancestor Transform node instead.

#### Warning

- Simple-geometry dimensions are initializeOnly and cannot be changed after initial creation, avoiding the need for potentially expensive tessellation at run time.

### SFBool [ ] **solid** FALSE

Setting *solid* true means draw only one side of polygons (backface culling on), setting *solid* false means draw both sides of polygons (backface culling off).

#### Hints

- Mnemonic "this geometry is *solid* like a brick" (you don't render the inside of a brick).
- If in doubt, use *solid*='false' for maximum visibility.
- (X3D version 4.0 draft) accessType relaxed to inputOutput in order to support animation and visualization.

#### Warnings

- Default value true can completely hide geometry if viewed from wrong side!
- *solid* false not supported in VRML97.

## Advisories

### Hint

- [Insert a Shape node before adding geometry or Appearance. Examples: X3D Example Archives, X3D for Web Authors, Chapter 10 Geometry 2D](https://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/X3dForWebAuthors/Chapter10Geometry2D){:target="_blank"}
