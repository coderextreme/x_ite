## Overview

Rectangle2D is a geometry node that defines a 2D rectangle in X-Y plane.

The Rectangle2D node belongs to the **Geometry2D** component and its default container field is *geometry.* It is available since X3D version 3.0 or later.

## Fields

### SFNode [in, out] **metadata** NULL <small>[X3DMetadataObject]</small>

Metadata are not part of the X3D world and not interpreted by the X3D browser, but they can be accessed via the ECMAScript interface.

### SFVec2f [ ] **size** 2 2 <small>(0,âˆž)</small>

2D dimensions of Rectangle2D.

#### Warning

- Simple-geometry dimensions are initializeOnly and cannot be changed after initial creation, for animation use Transform scale instead.

### SFBool [ ] **solid** FALSE

Setting solid true means draw only one side of polygons (backface culling on), setting solid false means draw both sides of polygons (backface culling off).

#### Hint

- If in doubt, use solid='false' for maximum visibility.

#### Warnings

- Default value true can completely hide geometry if viewed from wrong side! Solid false not supported in VRML97.

## Description

### Hint

- Insert a Shape node before adding geometry or Appearance.
