## Overview

Circle2D is a geometry node that defines a linear X-Y circle with center (0,0) in X-Y plane.

The Circle2D node belongs to the **Geometry2D** component and its container field is *geometry.* It is available since X3D version 3.0 or later.

## Fields

### SFNode [in, out] **metadata** NULL <small>[X3DMetadataObject]</small>

Metadata are not part of the X3D world and not interpreted by the X3D browser, but they can be accessed via the ECMAScript interface.

### SFFloat [ ] **radius** 1 <small>(0,âˆž)</small>

Circle radius.

#### Warning

Simple-geometry dimensions are initializeOnly and cannot be changed after initial creation, for animation use Transform scale instead.
