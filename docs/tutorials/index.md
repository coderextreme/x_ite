## Tutorials

We offer here a couple of introductory X3D tutorials on X3D concepts. It serves as background material for Titania and X\_ITE.

The only hardware and software requirement for most of the tutorials is a computer with the latest version of Titania or your favorite text editor and X\_ITE. Titania has extensive documentation. It is the perfect environment to get started in creating sensational X3D scenes.
